NOW:

1. Add base url for app to `kbase_ui_py/urls.py`

   ```python
   path('MYAPP/', include('MYAPP.urls')),
   ```

2. Add to `settings.py`

   Add an entry to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

   ```python
   'MYAPP.apps.MyappConfig',
   ```

   This matches the file `MYAPP/apps.py` inside of which you'll find a class generated `MyappConfig`, where `Myapp` is the proper-cased version of the app name.

Then you are done!
